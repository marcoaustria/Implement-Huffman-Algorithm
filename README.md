# Implement-Huffman-Algorithm
Project for COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms


ASSIGNMENT:

Write a program to:

-read a file

-calculate the frequency of each character in the file

-place the characters and frequencies into a table indexed by the character

-run the character frequency through Huffmans Algorithm and create a Huffman Tree
    https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/Everything/html/Huffman.html
    This site gives code for BuildTree (algorithm) HuffTree (object) and HuffLeaf that would work for this.
    You are welcome to use this code and reference it.

-traverse the Huffman Tree and print out the characters and frequencies

-read a file and encode the characters in the file using a Huffman Tree

-decode a string of 1s and 0s using a Huffman Tree
